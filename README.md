# Welcome to the Beginner's Python Coding Practice Repository!

Hey there, fellow coders! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little corner of the coding world, where I'm embarking on an exciting journey of learning Python as a beginner. In this repository, I'm practicing Python coding using questions from the renowned LeetCode Top Interview 150 list.

## About This Repository

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to hone my Python coding skills while tackling real-world problems. It's a place where I can experiment, learn, and grow as a coder.

### LeetCode Top Interview 150
The questions I'm working on are sourced from the LeetCode Top Interview 150 list. These questions are carefully selected to cover a wide range of concepts and difficulty levels, making them perfect for practice.

### Contribution Guidelines
I strongly encourage fellow coders to contribute to this repository! Whether you're a beginner like me or a seasoned pro, your insights, suggestions, and solutions are highly valued. Let's learn from each other and make progress together!

### Finding Issues
If you come across any issues or bugs in the code, please don't hesitate to let me know by opening an issue. Your feedback helps me improve and ensures the quality of the solutions.

### Solution Clarifications
Just a heads up: the solutions provided here might not always pass all LeetCode test cases. Why? Because I'm a beginner, and I'm still learning! Also, I want to emphasize that the solutions were initially tested in Intellij IDEA, but that doesn't guarantee their success on LeetCode.

### File Naming Convention
You might notice some files with names ending in `(0)` or `(1)`. Here's what they mean:
- `(0)`: I wasn't able to find a solution for these problems yet. They're open for collaboration, so feel free to jump in and work on them with me!
- `(1)`: I managed to find a solution for these problems after doing some research, but I'm not entirely confident about them. I'd love to collaborate with others to improve and clarify these solutions.

## Let's Connect!

I'm excited to connect with fellow coders and learn from your experiences. Feel free to reach out, share your thoughts, or collaborate on solving problems together. Let's make coding fun and rewarding for everyone involved!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
